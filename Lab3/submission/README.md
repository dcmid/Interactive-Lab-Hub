# Motors, Power, Paper Prototyping

### Part 1. Connect the Servo to your breadboard

**a. Which color wires correspond to power, ground and signal?**
- Red -> Power
- Brown -> Ground
- Orange -> Signal

### Part 2. Connect the Servo to your Arduino

**a. Which Arduino pin should the signal line of the servo be attached to?**  
9

**b. What aspects of the Servo code control angle or speed?**
- Angle - pos
- Speed - loop delay or pos increment amount

## Part C. Integrating input and output

My code can be found [here](./code/servo_pot/servo_pot.ino)\.
## Part D. Autonomy!

**Include a photo/movie of your autonomous device in action.**  

My code can be found [here](./code/servo_pot/servo_pot.ino)\.  
A video of my device can be found [here](./media/servo_pot.mp4)\.

## Part E. Paper display
**a. Make a video of your paper display in action.**

My code can be found [here](./code/servo_count/servo_count.ino)\.  
The video can be found [here](./media/servo_count.mp4)\.

## Part F. Make it your own

I modified my previous design to track the time between button presses, acting like a rudimentary speedometer.  

**a. Make a video of your final design in action.**  

My code can be found [here](./code/servo_race/servo_race.ino)\.  
The video can be found [here](./media/servo_speed.mp4)\.
